				<span>The chief of the strangers rendered him answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>War-troopers’ leader, and word-treasure opened:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“We are sprung from the lineage of the people of Geatland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Higelac’s hearth-friends. To heroes unnumbered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father was known, a noble head-warrior</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ecgtheow titled; many a winter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He lived with the people, ere he passed on his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old from his dwelling; each of the counsellors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Widely mid world-folk well remembers him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We, kindly of spirit, the lord of thy people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The son of King Healfdene, have come here to visit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Folk-troop’s defender: be free in thy counsels!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the noble one bear we a weighty commission,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The helm of the Danemen; we shall hide, I ween,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Naught of our message. Thou know’st if it happen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As we soothly heard say, that some savage despoiler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some hidden pursuer, on nights that are murky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By deeds very direful ’mid the Danemen exhibits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hatred unheard of, horrid destruction</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the falling of dead. From feelings least selfish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am able to render counsel to Hrothgar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How he, wise and worthy, may worst the destroyer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the anguish of sorrow should ever be lessened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comfort come to him, and care-waves grow cooler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ever hereafter he agony suffer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And troublous distress, while towereth upward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The handsomest of houses high on the summit.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bestriding his stallion, the strand-watchman answered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The doughty retainer: “The difference surely</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twixt words and works, the warlike shield-bearer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who judgeth wisely well shall determine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This band, I hear, beareth no malice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the prince of the Scyldings. Pass ye then onward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With weapons and armor. I shall lead you in person;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my war-trusty vassals command I shall issue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep from all injury your excellent vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your fresh-tarred craft, ’gainst every opposer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close by the sea-shore, till the curved-neckèd bark shall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waft back again the well-beloved hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the way of the water to Weder dominions.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To warrior so great ’twill be granted sure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the storm of strife to stand secure.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Onward they fared then (the vessel lay quiet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The broad-bosomed bark was bound by its cable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly at anchor); the boar-signs glistened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright on the visors vivid with gilding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blaze-hardened, brilliant; the boar acted warden.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heroes hastened, hurried the liegemen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descended together, till they saw the great palace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The well-fashioned wassail-hall wondrous and gleaming:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Mid world-folk and kindreds that was widest reputed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of halls under heaven which the hero abode in;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its lustre enlightened lands without number.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the battle-brave hero showed them the glittering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Court of the bold ones, that they easily thither</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might fare on their journey; the aforementioned warrior</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning his courser, quoth as he left them:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ’Tis time I were faring; Father Almighty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant you His grace, and give you to journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safe on your mission! To the sea I will get me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst hostile warriors as warden to stand.”</span>
