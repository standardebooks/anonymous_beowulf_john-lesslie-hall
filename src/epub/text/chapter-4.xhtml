				<p>
					<span>So Healfdene’s kinsman constantly mused on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His long-lasting sorrow; the battle-thane clever</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was not anywise able evils to ’scape from:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too crushing the sorrow that came to the people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loathsome and lasting the life-grinding torture,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greatest of night-woes. So Higelac’s liegeman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good amid Geatmen, of Grendel’s achievements</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heard in his home: of heroes then living</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was stoutest and strongest, sturdy and noble.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bade them prepare him a bark that was trusty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said he the war-king would seek o’er the ocean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk-leader noble, since he needed retainers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the perilous project prudent companions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chided him little, though loving him dearly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They egged the brave atheling, augured him glory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The excellent knight from the folk of the Geatmen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had liegemen selected, likest to prove them</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trustworthy warriors; with fourteen companions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The vessel he looked for; a liegeman then showed them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sea-crafty man, the bounds of the country.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fast the days fleeted; the float was a-water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The craft by the cliff. Clomb to the prow then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well-equipped warriors: the wave-currents twisted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea on the sand; soldiers then carried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the breast of the vessel bright-shining jewels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Handsome war-armor; heroes outshoved then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Warmen the wood-ship, on its wished-for adventure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The foamy-necked floater fanned by the breeze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likest a bird, glided the waters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till twenty and four hours thereafter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The twist-stemmed vessel had traveled such distance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the sailing-men saw the sloping embankments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea cliffs gleaming, precipitous mountains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nesses<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> enormous: they were nearing the limits</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the end of the ocean. Up thence quickly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The men of the Weders clomb to the mainland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fastened their vessel (battle weeds rattled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>War burnies clattered), the Wielder they thanked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the ways o’er the waters had waxen so gentle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then well from the cliff edge the guard of the Scyldings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who the sea-cliffs should see to, saw o’er the gangway</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brave ones bearing beauteous targets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Armor all ready, anxiously thought he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Musing and wondering what men were approaching.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High on his horse then Hrothgar’s retainer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turned him to coastward, mightily brandished</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His lance in his hands, questioned with boldness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who are ye men here, mail-covered warriors</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clad in your corslets, come thus a-driving</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A high riding ship o’er the shoals of the waters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hither ’neath helmets have hied o’er the ocean?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have been strand-guard, standing as warden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lest enemies ever anywise ravage</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Danish dominions with army of war-ships.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More boldly never have warriors ventured</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hither to come; of kinsmen’s approval,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Word-leave of warriors, I ween<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> that ye surely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing have known. Never a greater one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of earls o’er the earth have <em>I</em> had a sight of</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than is one of your number, a hero in armor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No low-ranking fellow adorned with his weapons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But launching them little, unless looks are deceiving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And striking appearance. Ere ye pass on your journey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As treacherous spies to the land of the Scyldings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And farther fare, I fully must know now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What race ye belong to. Ye far-away dwellers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sea-faring sailors, my simple opinion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hear ye and hearken: haste is most fitting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plainly to tell me what place ye are come from.”</span>
