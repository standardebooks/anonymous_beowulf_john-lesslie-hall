				<span>The stranger began then to vomit forth fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To burn the great manor; the blaze then glimmered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For anguish to earlmen, not anything living</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was the hateful air-goer willing to leave there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The war of the worm widely was noticed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The feud of the foeman afar and anear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the enemy injured the earls of the Geatmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harried with hatred: back he hied to the treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the well-hidden cavern ere the coming of daylight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had circled with fire the folk of those regions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With brand and burning; in the barrow he trusted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the wall and his war-might: the weening deceived him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then straight was the horror to Beowulf published,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Early forsooth, that his own native homestead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The best of buildings, was burning and melting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gift-seat of Geatmen. ’Twas a grief to the spirit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the good-mooded hero, the greatest of sorrows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wise one weened then that wielding his kingdom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst the ancient commandments, he had bitterly angered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lord everlasting: with lorn meditations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His bosom welled inward, as was nowise his custom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire-spewing dragon fully had wasted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fastness of warriors, the water-land outward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The manor with fire. The folk-ruling hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prince of the Weders, was planning to wreak him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warmen’s defender bade them to make him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earlmen’s atheling, an excellent war-shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wholly of iron: fully he knew then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wood from the forest was helpless to aid him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shield against fire. The long-worthy ruler</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must live the last of his limited earth-days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of life in the world and the worm along with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though he long had been holding hoard-wealth in plenty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the ring-prince disdained to seek with a war-band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With army extensive, the air-going ranger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He felt no fear of the foeman’s assaults and</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He counted for little the might of the dragon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His power and prowess: for previously dared he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A heap of hostility, hazarded dangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>War-thane, when Hrothgar’s palace he cleansèd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conquering combatant, clutched in the battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kinsmen of Grendel, of kindred detested.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas of hand-fights not least where Higelac was slaughtered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the king of the Geatmen with clashings of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friend-lord of folks in Frisian dominions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Offspring of Hrethrel perished through sword-drink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With battle-swords beaten; thence Beowulf came then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On self-help relying, swam through the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He bare on his arm, lone-going, thirty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outfits of armor, when the ocean he mounted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Hetwars by no means had need to be boastful</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their fighting afoot, who forward to meet him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carried their war-shields: not many returned from</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brave-mooded battle-knight back to their homesteads.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ecgtheow’s bairn o’er the bight-courses swam then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lone-goer lorn to his land-folk returning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Hygd to him tendered treasure and kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rings and dominion: her son she not trusted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be able to keep the kingdom devised him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst alien races, on the death of King Higelac.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the sad ones succeeded not in persuading the atheling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In any way ever, to act as a suzerain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Heardred, or promise to govern the kingdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet with friendly counsel in the folk he sustained him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gracious, with honor, till he grew to be older,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wielded the Weders. Wide-fleeing outlaws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ohthere’s sons, sought him o’er the waters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They had stirred a revolt ’gainst the helm of the Scylfings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The best of the sea-kings, who in Swedish dominions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Distributed treasure, distinguished folk-leader.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas the end of his earth-days; injury fatal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By swing of the sword he received as a greeting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Offspring of Higelac; Ongentheow’s bairn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Later departed to visit his homestead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Heardred was dead; let Beowulf rule them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Govern the Geatmen: good was that folk-king.</span>
