					<span>Then he saw mid the war-gems a weapon of victory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An ancient giant-sword, of edges a-doughty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glory of warriors: of weapons ’twas choicest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only ’twas larger than any man else was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Able to bear to the battle-encounter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The good and splendid work of the giants.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He grasped then the sword-hilt, knight of the Scyldings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bold and battle-grim, brandished his ring-sword,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hopeless of living, hotly he smote her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the fiend-woman’s neck firmly it grappled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Broke through her bone-joints, the bill fully pierced her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fate-cursèd body, she fell to the ground then:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hand-sword was bloody, the hero exulted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brand was brilliant, brightly it glimmered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just as from heaven gemlike shineth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The torch of the firmament. He glanced ’long the building,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turned by the wall then, Higelac’s vassal</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Raging and wrathful raised his battle-sword</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strong by the handle. The edge was not useless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the hero-in-battle, but he speedily wished to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give Grendel requital for the many assaults he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had worked on the West-Danes not once, but often,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he slew in slumber the subjects of Hrothgar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the folk of the Danemen, and fully as many</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Carried away, a horrible prey.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gave him requital, grim-raging champion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he saw on his rest-place weary of conflict</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grendel lying, of life-joys bereavèd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the battle at Heorot erstwhile had scathed him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His body far bounded, a blow when he suffered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death having seized him, sword-smiting heavy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he cut off his head then. Early this noticed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clever carles who as comrades of Hrothgar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gazed on the sea-deeps, that the surging wave-currents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were mightily mingled, the mere-flood was gory:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the good one the gray-haired together held converse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hoary of head, that they hoped not to see again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The atheling ever, that exulting in victory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’d return there to visit the distinguished folk-ruler:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then many concluded the mere-wolf had killed him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ninth hour came then. From the ness-edge departed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bold-mooded Scyldings; the gold-friend of heroes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Homeward betook him. The strangers sat down then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soul-sick, sorrowful, the sea-waves regarding:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They wished and yet weened not their well-loved friend-lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see any more. The sword-blade began then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blood having touched it, contracting and shriveling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With battle-icicles; ’twas a wonderful marvel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it melted entirely, likest to ice when</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Father unbindeth the bond of the frost and</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unwindeth the wave-bands, He who wieldeth dominion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of times and of tides: a truth-firm Creator.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor took he of jewels more in the dwelling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lord of the Weders, though they lay all around him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than the head and the handle handsome with jewels;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brand early melted, burnt was the weapon:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So hot was the blood, the strange-spirit poisonous</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That in it did perish. He early swam off then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who had bided in combat the carnage of haters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went up through the ocean; the eddies were cleansèd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spacious expanses, when the spirit from farland</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His life put aside and this short-lived existence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The seamen’s defender came swimming to land then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doughty of spirit, rejoiced in his sea-gift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bulky burden which he bore in his keeping.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The excellent vassals advanced then to meet him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To God they were grateful, were glad in their chieftain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to see him safe and sound was granted them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the high-minded hero, then, helmet and burnie</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were speedily loosened: the ocean was putrid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water ’neath welkin weltered with gore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth did they fare, then, their footsteps retracing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Merry and mirthful, measured the earth-way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The highway familiar: men very daring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bare then the head from the sea-cliff, burdening</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each of the earlmen, excellent-valiant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Four of them had to carry with labor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The head of Grendel to the high towering gold-hall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upstuck on the spear, till fourteen most-valiant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And battle-brave Geatmen came there going</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight to the palace: the prince of the people</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Measured the mead-ways, their mood-brave companion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The atheling of earlmen entered the building,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deed-valiant man, adorned with distinction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doughty shield-warrior, to address King Hrothgar:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then hung by the hair, the head of Grendel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was borne to the building, where beer-thanes were drinking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loth before earlmen and eke ’fore the lady:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The warriors beheld then a wonderful sight.</span>
