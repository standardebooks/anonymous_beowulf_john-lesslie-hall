					<span>Hrothgar discoursed, helm of the Scyldings:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘To defend our folk and to furnish assistance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou soughtest us hither, good friend Beowulf.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fiercest of feuds thy father engaged in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="span-5">Heatholaf killed he in hand-to-hand conflict</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Mid Wilfingish warriors; then the Wederish people</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For fear of a feud were forced to disown him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence flying he fled to the folk of the South-Danes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The race of the Scyldings, o’er the roll of the waters;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had lately begun then to govern the Danemen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hoard-seat of heroes held in my youth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rich in its jewels: dead was Heregar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My kinsman and elder had earth-joys forsaken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Healfdene his bairn. He was better than I am!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That feud thereafter for a fee I compounded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the weltering waters to the Wilfings I sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ornaments old; oaths did he swear me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It pains me in spirit to any to tell it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What grief in Heorot Grendel hath caused me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What horror unlooked-for, by hatred unceasing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Waned is my war-band, wasted my hall-troop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weird hath offcast them to the clutches of Grendel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God can easily hinder the scather</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From deeds so direful. Oft drunken with beer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the ale-vessel promised warriors in armor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They would willingly wait on the wassailing-benches</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A grapple with Grendel, with grimmest of edges.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then this mead-hall at morning with murder was reeking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The building was bloody at breaking of daylight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bench-deals all flooded, dripping and bloodied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk-hall was gory: I had fewer retainers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dear-beloved warriors, whom death had laid hold of.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sit at the feast now, thy intents unto heroes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy victor-fame show, as thy spirit doth urge thee!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the men of the Geats then together assembled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the beer-hall blithesome a bench was made ready;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There warlike in spirit they went to be seated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Proud and exultant. A liegeman did service,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who a beaker embellished bore with decorum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gleaming-drink poured. The gleeman sang whilom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearty in Heorot; there was heroes’ rejoicing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A numerous war-band of Weders and Danemen.</span>
