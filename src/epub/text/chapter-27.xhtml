					<span>Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow’s offspring:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We men of the water wish to declare now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fared from far-lands, we’re firmly determined</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To seek King Higelac. Here have we fitly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Been welcomed and feasted, as heart would desire it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good was the greeting. If greater affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am anywise able ever on earth to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gain at thy hands, ruler of heroes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than yet I have done, I shall quickly be ready</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For combat and conflict. O’er the course of the waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Learn I that neighbors alarm thee with terror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As haters did whilom, I hither will bring thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For help unto heroes henchmen by thousands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know as to Higelac, the lord of the Geatmen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though young in years, he yet will permit me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By words and by works, ward of the people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fully to furnish thee forces and bear thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My lance to relieve thee, if liegemen shall fail thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And help of my hand-strength; if Hrethric be treating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bairn of the king, at the court of the Geatmen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thereat may find him friends in abundance:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faraway countries he were better to seek for</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who trusts in himself.” Hrothgar discoursed then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Making rejoinder: “These words thou hast uttered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All-knowing God hath given thy spirit!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er heard I an earlman thus early in life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More clever in speaking: thou’rt cautious of spirit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mighty of muscle, in mouth-answers prudent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I count on the hope that, happen it ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That missile shall rob thee of Hrethel’s descendant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Edge-horrid battle, and illness or weapon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deprive thee of prince, of people’s protector,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And life thou yet holdest, the Sea-Geats will never</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Find a more fitting folk-lord to choose them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gem-ward of heroes, than <em>thou</em> mightest prove thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If the kingdom of kinsmen thou carest to govern.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy mood-spirit likes me the longer the better,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beowulf dear: thou hast brought it to pass that</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To both these peoples peace shall be common,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Geat-folk and Danemen, the strife be suspended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The secret assailings they suffered in yore-days;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And also that jewels be shared while I govern</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wide-stretching kingdom, and that many shall visit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Others o’er the ocean with excellent gift-gems:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ring-adorned bark shall bring o’er the currents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Presents and love-gifts. This people I know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tow’rd foeman and friend firmly established,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After ancient etiquette everywise blameless.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the warden of earlmen gave him still farther,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kinsman of Healfdene, a dozen of jewels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bade him safely seek with the presents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His well-beloved people, early returning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the noble-born king kissed the distinguished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dear-lovèd liegeman, the Dane-prince saluted him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And claspèd his neck; tears from him fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the gray-headed man: he two things expected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Agèd and reverend, but rather the second,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bold in council they’d meet thereafter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The man was so dear that he failed to suppress the</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Emotions that moved him, but in mood-fetters fastened</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The long-famous hero longeth in secret</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deep in his spirit for the dear-beloved man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though not a blood-kinsman. Beowulf thenceward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gold-splendid warrior, walked o’er the meadows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exulting in treasure: the sea-going vessel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Riding at anchor awaited its owner.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As they pressed on their way then, the present of Hrothgar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was frequently referred to: a folk-king indeed that</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Everyway blameless, till age did debar him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The joys of his might, which hath many oft injured.</span>
