					<span>The highway glistened with many-hued pebble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A by-path led the liegemen together.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Firm and hand-locked the war-burnie glistened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ring-sword radiant rang ’mid the armor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the party was approaching the palace together</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In warlike equipments. ’Gainst the wall of the building</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their wide-fashioned war-shields they weary did set then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Battle-shields sturdy; benchward they turned then;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their battle-sarks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a> rattled, the gear of the heroes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lances stood up then, all in a cluster,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The arms of the seamen, ashen-shafts mounted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With edges of iron: the armor-clad troopers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were decked with weapons. Then a proud-mooded hero</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Asked of the champions questions of lineage:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“From what borders bear ye your battle-shields plated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gilded and gleaming, your gray-colored burnies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helmets with visors and heap of war-lances?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Hrothgar the king I am servant and liegeman.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Mong folk from far-lands found I have never</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men so many of mien more courageous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I ween that from valor, nowise as outlaws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But from greatness of soul ye sought for King Hrothgar.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the strength-famous earlman answer rendered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The proud-mooded Wederchief replied to his question,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hardy ’neath helmet: “Higelac’s mates are we;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beowulf hight I. To the bairn of Healfdene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The famous folk-leader, I freely will tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thy prince my commission, if pleasantly hearing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’ll grant we may greet him so gracious to all men.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wulfgar replied then (he was prince of the Wendels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His boldness of spirit was known unto many,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His prowess and prudence): “The prince of the Scyldings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The friend-lord of Danemen, I will ask of thy journey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The giver of rings, as thou urgest me do it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk-chief famous, and inform thee early</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What answer the good one mindeth to render me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He turned then hurriedly where Hrothgar was sitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old and hoary, his earlmen attending him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strength-famous went till he stood at the shoulder</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="span-40">Of the lord of the Danemen, of courteous thanemen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The custom he minded. Wulfgar addressed then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His friendly liegelord: “Folk of the Geatmen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the way of the waters are wafted hither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faring from far-lands: the foremost in rank</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The battle-champions Beowulf title.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They make this petition: with thee, O my chieftain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be granted a conference; O gracious King Hrothgar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Friendly answer refuse not to give them!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In war-trappings weeded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> worthy they seem</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of earls to be honored; sure the atheling is doughty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who headed the heroes hitherward coming.”</span>
