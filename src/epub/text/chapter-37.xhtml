					<span>Then I heard that at need of the king of the people</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The upstanding earlman exhibited prowess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vigor and courage, as suited his nature;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He his head did not guard, but the high-minded liegeman’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hand was consumed, when he succored his kinsman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he struck the strife-bringing strange-comer lower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earl-thane in armor, that <em>in</em> went the weapon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gleaming and plated, that ’gan then the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Later to lessen. The liegelord himself then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Retained his consciousness, brandished his war-knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Battle-sharp, bitter, that he bare on his armor:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Weder-lord cut the worm in the middle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had felled the enemy (life drove out then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Puissant prowess), the pair had destroyed him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Land-chiefs related: so a liegeman should prove him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thaneman when needed. To the prince ’twas the last of</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His era of conquest by his own great achievements,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The latest of world-deeds. The wound then began</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which the earth-dwelling dragon erstwhile had wrought him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To burn and to swell. He soon then discovered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That bitterest bale-woe in his bosom was raging,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Poison within. The atheling advanced then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That along by the wall, he prudent of spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might sit on a settle; he saw the giant-work,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How arches of stone strengthened with pillars</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The earth-hall eternal inward supported.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the long-worthy liegeman laved with his hand the</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far-famous chieftain, gory from sword-edge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Refreshing the face of his friend-lord and ruler,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sated with battle, unbinding his helmet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beowulf answered, of his injury spake he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wound that was fatal (he was fully aware</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had lived his allotted life-days enjoying</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pleasures of earth; then past was entirely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His measure of days, death very near):</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My son I would give now my battle-equipments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had any of heirs been after me granted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along of my body. This people I governed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fifty of winters: no king ’mong my neighbors</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dared to encounter me with comrades-in-battle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Try me with terror. The time to me ordered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I bided at home, mine own kept fitly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sought me no snares, swore me not many</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oaths in injustice. Joy over all this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’m able to have, though ill with my death-wounds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence the Ruler of Earthmen need not charge me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the killing of kinsmen, when cometh my life out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth from my body. Fare thou with haste now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To behold the hoard ’neath the hoar-grayish stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well-lovèd Wiglaf, now the worm is a-lying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sore-wounded sleepeth, disseized of his treasure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go thou in haste that treasures of old I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gold-wealth may gaze on, together see lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ether-bright jewels, be easier able,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Having the heap of hoard-gems, to yield my</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Life and the land-folk whom long I have governed.”</span>
