			<p>
				<span>Unferth spoke up, Ecglaf his son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opened the jousting (the journey of Beowulf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sea-farer doughty, gave sorrow to Unferth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And greatest chagrin, too, for granted he never</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That any man else on earth should attain to,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gain under heaven, more glory than he):</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Art thou that Beowulf with Breca did struggle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the wide sea-currents at swimming contended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From vainest vaunting adventured your bodies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In care of the waters? And no one was able</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor lief nor loth one, in the least to dissuade you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your difficult voyage; then ye ventured a-swimming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where your arms outstretching the streams ye did cover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mere-ways<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a> measured, mixing and stirring them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glided the ocean; angry the waves were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the weltering of winter. In the water’s possession,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye toiled for a seven-night; he at swimming outdid thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In strength excelled thee. Then early at morning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Heathoremes’ shore the holm-currents tossed him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought he thenceward the home of his fathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beloved of his liegemen, the land of the Brondings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The peace-castle pleasant, where a people he wielded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had borough and jewels. The pledge that he made thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The son of Beanstan hath soothly accomplished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though ever triumphant in onset of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A grim grappling, if Grendel thou darest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the space of a night near-by to wait for!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beowulf answered, offspring of Ecgtheow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My good friend Unferth, sure freely and wildly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou fuddled with beer of Breca hast spoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast told of his journey! A fact I allege it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That greater strength in the waters I had then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ills in the ocean, than any man else had.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We made agreement as the merest of striplings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Promised each other (both of us then were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Younkers in years) that we yet would adventure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out on the ocean; it all we accomplished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While swimming the sea-floods, sword-blade unscabbarded</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boldly we brandished, our bodies expected</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shield from the sharks. He sure was unable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To swim on the waters further than I could,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More swift on the waves, nor <em>would</em> I from him go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then we two companions stayed in the ocean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five nights together, till the currents did part us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The weltering waters, weathers the bleakest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nethermost night, and the north-wind whistled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fierce in our faces; fell were the billows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mere fishes’ mood was mightily ruffled:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there against foemen my firm-knotted corslet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hand-jointed, hardy, help did afford me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My battle-sark braided, brilliantly gilded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay on my bosom. To the bottom then dragged me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hateful fiend-scather, seized me and held me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grim in his grapple: ’twas granted me, nathless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pierce the monster with the point of my weapon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My obedient blade; battle offcarried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mighty mere-creature by means of my hand-blow.</span>
