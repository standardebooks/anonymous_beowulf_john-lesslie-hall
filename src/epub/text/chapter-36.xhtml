			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>The son of Weohstan was Wiglaf entitled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shield-warrior precious, prince of the Scylfings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aelfhere’s kinsman: he saw his dear liegelord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enduring the heat ’neath helmet and visor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he minded the holding that erst he had given him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Waegmunding warriors’ wealth-blessèd homestead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each of the folk-rights his father had wielded;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was hot for the battle, his hand seized the target,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The yellow-bark shield, he unsheathed his old weapon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which was known among earthmen as the relic of Eanmund,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ohthere’s offspring, whom, exiled and friendless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weohstan did slay with sword-edge in battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carried his kinsman the clear-shining helmet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ring-made burnie, the old giant-weapon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Onela gave him, his boon-fellow’s armor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ready war-trappings: he the feud did not mention,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though he’d fatally smitten the son of his brother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many a half-year held he the treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bill and the burnie, till his bairn became able,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like his father before him, fame-deeds to ’complish;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he gave him ’mong Geatmen a goodly array of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeds for his warfare; he went from life then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old on his journey. ’Twas the earliest time then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the youthful champion might charge in the battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aiding his liegelord; his spirit was dauntless.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor did kinsman’s bequest quail at the battle:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the dragon discovered on their coming together.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wiglaf uttered many a right-saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said to his fellows, sad was his spirit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I remember the time when, tasting the mead-cup,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We promised in the hall the lord of us all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who gave us these ring-treasures, that this battle-equipment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swords and helmets, we’d certainly quite him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should need of such aid ever befall him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the war-band he chose us for this journey spontaneously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stirred us to glory and gave me these jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since he held and esteemed us trust-worthy spearmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hardy helm-bearers, though this hero-achievement</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our lord intended alone to accomplish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ward of his people, for most of achievements,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doings audacious, he did among earth-folk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The day is now come when the ruler of earthmen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needeth the vigor of valiant heroes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us wend us towards him, the war-prince to succor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the heat yet rageth, horrible fire-fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God wot in me, ’tis mickle the liefer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blaze should embrace my body and eat it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my treasure-bestower. Meseemeth not proper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bear our battle-shields back to our country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Less first we are able to fell and destroy the</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long-hating foeman, to defend the life of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prince of the Weders. Well do I know ’tisn’t</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earned by his exploits, he only of Geatmen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorrow should suffer, sink in the battle:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brand and helmet to us both shall be common,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shield-cover, burnie.” Through the bale-smoke he stalked then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went under helmet to the help of his chieftain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Briefly discoursing: “Beowulf dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perform thou all fully, as thou formerly saidst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy youthful years, that while yet thou livedst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wouldst let thine honor not ever be lessened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy life thou shalt save, mighty in actions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Atheling undaunted, with all of thy vigor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’ll give thee assistance.” The dragon came raging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild-mooded stranger, when these words had been uttered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(’Twas the second occasion), seeking his enemies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men that were hated, with hot-gleaming fire-waves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With blaze-billows burned the board to its edges:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fight-armor failed then to furnish assistance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the youthful spear-hero: but the young-agèd stripling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly advanced ’neath his kinsman’s war-target,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since his own had been ground in the grip of the fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the warrior-king was careful of glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He soundly smote with sword-for-the-battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it stood in the head by hatred driven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Naegling was shivered, the old and iron-made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brand of Beowulf in battle deceived him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas denied him that edges of irons were able</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To help in the battle; the hand was too mighty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which every weapon, as I heard on inquiry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outstruck in its stroke, when to struggle he carried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wonderful war-sword: it waxed him no better.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the people-despoiler⁠—third of his onsets⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fierce-raging fire-drake, of feud-hate was mindful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charged on the strong one, when chance was afforded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heated and war-grim, seized on his neck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With teeth that were bitter; he bloody did wax with</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soul-gore seething; sword-blood in waves boiled.</span>
