					<span>Then Hrothgar departed, his earl-throng attending him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Folk-lord of Scyldings, forth from the building;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The war-chieftain wished then Wealhtheow to look for,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The queen for a bedmate. To keep away Grendel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Glory of Kings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a> had given a hall-watch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As men heard recounted: for the king of the Danemen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He did special service, gave the giant a watcher:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the prince of the Geatmen implicitly trusted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His warlike strength and the Wielder’s protection.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His armor of iron off him he did then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His helmet from his head, to his henchman committed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His chased-handled chain-sword, choicest of weapons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bade him bide with his battle-equipments.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The good one then uttered words of defiance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beowulf Geatman, ere his bed he upmounted:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I hold me no meaner in matters of prowess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In warlike achievements, than Grendel does himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence I seek not with sword-edge to sooth him to slumber,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of life to bereave him, though well I am able.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No battle-skill has he, that blows he should strike me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To shatter my shield, though sure he is mighty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In strife and destruction; but struggling by night we</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall do without edges, dare he to look for</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weaponless warfare, and wise-mooded Father</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glory apportion, God ever-holy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which hand soever to him seemeth proper.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the brave-mooded hero bent to his slumber,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pillow received the cheek of the noble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a martial mere-thane attending</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sank to his slumber. Seemed it unlikely</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ever thereafter any should hope to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be happy at home, hero-friends visit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the lordly troop-castle where he lived from his childhood;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had heard how slaughter had snatched from the wine-hall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had recently ravished, of the race of the Scyldings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too many by far. But the Lord to them granted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The weaving of war-speed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a> to Wederish heroes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aid and comfort, that every opponent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By one man’s war-might they worsted and vanquished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the might of himself; the truth is established</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That God Almighty hath governed for ages</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kindreds and nations. A night very lurid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The trav’ler-at-twilight came tramping and striding.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The warriors were sleeping who should watch the horned-building,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One only excepted. ’Mid earthmen ’twas ’stablished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Th’ implacable foeman was powerless to hurl them</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the land of shadows, if the Lord were unwilling;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But serving as warder, in terror to foemen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He angrily bided the issue of battle.</span>
