				<span>In the mist of the morning many a warrior</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood round the gift-hall, as the story is told me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Folk-princes fared then from far and from near</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through long-stretching journeys to look at the wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The footprints of the foeman. Few of the warriors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who gazed on the foot-tracks of the inglorious creature</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His parting from life pained very deeply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How, weary in spirit, off from those regions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In combats conquered he carried his traces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fated and flying, to the flood of the nickers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in bloody billows bubbled the currents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The angry eddy was everywhere mingled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seething with gore, welling with sword-blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He death-doomed had hid him, when reaved of his joyance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He laid down his life in the lair he had fled to,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His heathenish spirit, where hell did receive him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence the friends from of old backward turned them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a younker from merry adventure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Striding their stallions, stout from the seaward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes on horses. There were heard very often</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beowulf’s praises; many often asserted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That neither south nor north, in the circuit of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er outstretching earth-plain, none other was better</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Mid bearers of war-shields, more worthy to govern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Neath the arch of the ether. Not any, however,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst the friend-lord muttered, mocking-words uttered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Hrothgar the gracious (a good king he).</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oft the famed ones permitted their fallow-skinned horses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To run in rivalry, racing and chasing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the fieldways appeared to them fair and inviting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Known for their excellence; oft a thane of the folk-lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man of celebrity, mindful of rhythms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who ancient traditions treasured in memory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New word-groups found properly bound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bard after ’gan then Beowulf’s venture</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisely to tell of, and words that were clever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To utter skilfully, earnestly speaking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything told he that he heard as to Sigmund’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty achievements, many things hidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strife of the Waelsing, the wide-going ventures</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The children of men knew of but little,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The feud and the fury, but Fitela with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When suchlike matters he minded to speak of,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uncle to nephew, as in every contention</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each to other was ever devoted:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A numerous host of the race of the scathers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They had slain with the sword-edge. To Sigmund accrued then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No little of glory, when his life-days were over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since he sturdy in struggle had destroyed the great dragon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hoard-treasure’s keeper; ’neath the hoar-grayish stone he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The son of the atheling, unaided adventured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The perilous project; not present was Fitela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the fortune befell him of forcing his weapon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the marvellous dragon, that it stood in the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well-honored weapon; the worm was slaughtered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great one had gained then by his glorious achievement</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reap from the ring-hoard richest enjoyment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As best it did please him: his vessel he loaded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shining ornaments on the ship’s bosom carried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kinsman of Waels: the drake in heat melted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was farthest famed of fugitive pilgrims,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid wide-scattered world-folk, for works of great prowess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>War-troopers’ shelter: hence waxed he in honor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Afterward Heremod’s hero-strength failed him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His vigor and valor. ’Mid venomous haters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hands of foemen he was foully delivered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Offdriven early. Agony-billows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oppressed him too long, to his people he became then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the athelings, an ever-great burden;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the daring one’s journey in days of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many wise men were wont to deplore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as hoped he would bring them help in their sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the son of their ruler should rise into power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holding the headship held by his fathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should govern the people, the gold-hoard and borough,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kingdom of heroes, the realm of the Scyldings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He to all men became then far more beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Higelac’s kinsman, to kindreds and races,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his friends much dearer; him malice assaulted.⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oft running and racing on roadsters they measured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dun-colored highways. Then the light of the morning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was hurried and hastened. Went henchmen in numbers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the beautiful building, bold ones in spirit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To look at the wonder; the liegelord himself then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his wife-bower wending, warden of treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glorious trod with troopers unnumbered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famed for his virtues, and with him the queen-wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Measured the mead-ways, with maidens attending.</span>
