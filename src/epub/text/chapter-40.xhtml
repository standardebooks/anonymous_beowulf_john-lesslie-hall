					<span>Then he charged that the battle be announced at the hedge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up o’er the cliff-edge, where the earl-troopers bided</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whole of the morning, mood-wretched sat them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bearers of battle-shields, both things expecting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The end of his lifetime and the coming again of</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The liegelord belovèd. Little reserved he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of news that was known, who the ness-cliff did travel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he truly discoursed to all that could hear him:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now the free-giving friend-lord of the folk of the Weders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk-prince of Geatmen, is fast in his death-bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the deeds of the dragon in death-bed abideth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along with him lieth his life-taking foeman</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slain with knife-wounds: he was wholly unable</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To injure at all the ill-planning monster</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With bite of his sword-edge. Wiglaf is sitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Offspring of Wihstan, up over Beowulf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earl o’er another whose end-day hath reached him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Head-watch holdeth o’er heroes unliving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For friend and for foeman. The folk now expecteth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A season of strife when the death of the folk-king</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Frankmen and Frisians in far-lands is published.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The war-hatred waxed warm ’gainst the Hugmen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Higelac came with an army of vessels</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faring to Friesland, where the Frankmen in battle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Humbled him and bravely with overmight ’complished</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the mail-clad warrior must sink in the battle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell ’mid his folk-troop: no fret-gems presented</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The atheling to earlmen; aye was denied us</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Merewing’s mercy. The men of the Swedelands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For truce or for truth trust I but little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But widely ’twas known that near Ravenswood Ongentheow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sundered Haethcyn the Hrethling from life-joys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When for pride overweening the War-Scylfings first did</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seek the Geatmen with savage intentions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Early did Ohthere’s age-laden father,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old and terrible, give blow in requital,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Killing the sea-king, the queen-mother rescued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old one his consort deprived of her gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onela’s mother and Ohthere’s also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then followed the feud-nursing foemen till hardly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reaved of their ruler, they Ravenswood entered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then with vast-numbered forces he assaulted the remnant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weary with wounds, woe often promised</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The livelong night to the sad-hearted war-troop:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said he at morning would kill them with edges of weapons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some on the gallows for glee to the fowls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aid came after to the anxious-in-spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At dawn of the day, after Higelac’s bugle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And trumpet-sound heard they, when the good one proceeded</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And faring followed the flower of the troopers.</span>
