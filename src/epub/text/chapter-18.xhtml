					<span>‘Then the warriors departed to go to their dwellings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reaved of their friends, Friesland to visit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their homes and high-city. Hengest continued</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Biding with Finn the blood-tainted winter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wholly unsundered; of fatherland thought he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though unable to drive the ring-stemmèd vessel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the ways of the waters; the wave-deeps were tossing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fought with the wind; winter in ice-bonds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Closed up the currents, till there came to the dwelling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A year in its course, as yet it revolveth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If season propitious one alway regardeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>World-cheering weathers. Then winter was gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earth’s bosom was lovely; the exile would get him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The guest from the palace; on grewsomest vengeance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He brooded more eager than on oversea journeys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whe’r onset-of-anger he were able to ’complish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bairns of the Jutemen therein to remember.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nowise refused he the duties of liegeman</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Hun of the Frisians the battle-sword Láfing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fairest of falchions, friendly did give him:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its edges were famous in folk-talk of Jutland.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And savage sword-fury seized in its clutches</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bold-mooded Finn where he bode in his palace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the grewsome grapple Guthlaf and Oslaf</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had mournfully mentioned, the mere-journey over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sorrows half-blamed him; the flickering spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could not bide in his bosom. Then the building was covered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With corpses of foemen, and Finn too was slaughtered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The king with his comrades, and the queen made a prisoner.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The troops of the Scyldings bore to their vessels</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that the land-king had in his palace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such trinkets and treasures they took as, on searching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Finn’s they could find. They ferried to Daneland</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The excellent woman on oversea journey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Led her to their land-folk.’ The lay was concluded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gleeman’s recital. Shouts again rose then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bench-glee resounded, bearers then offered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wine from wonder-vats. Wealhtheo advanced then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Going ’neath gold-crown, where the good ones were seated</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uncle and nephew; their peace was yet mutual,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True each to the other. And Unferth the spokesman</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each trusted his spirit that his mood was courageous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though at fight he had failed in faith to his kinsmen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the queen of the Scyldings: ‘My lord and protector,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Treasure-bestower, take thou this beaker;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joyance attend thee, gold-friend of heroes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And greet thou the Geatmen with gracious responses!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So ought one to do. Be kind to the Geatmen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In gifts not niggardly; anear and afar now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peace thou enjoyest. Report hath informed me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou’lt have for a bairn the battle-brave hero.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now is Heorot cleansèd, ring-palace gleaming;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give while thou mayest many rewards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bequeath to thy kinsmen kingdom and people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On wending thy way to the Wielder’s splendor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know good Hrothulf, that the noble young troopers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’ll care for and honor, lord of the Scyldings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If earth-joys thou endest earlier than he doth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I reckon that recompense he’ll render with kindness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our offspring and issue, if that all he remember,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What favors of yore, when he yet was an infant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We awarded to him for his worship and pleasure.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then she turned by the bench where her sons were carousing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hrethric and Hrothmund, and the heroes’ offspring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The war-youth together; there the good one was sitting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt the brothers twain, Beowulf Geatman.</span>
