					<span>When the sun was sunken, he set out to visit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lofty hall-building, how the Ring-Danes had used it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For beds and benches when the banquet was over.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he found there reposing many a noble</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="span-5">Asleep after supper; sorrow the heroes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="span-6">Misery knew not. The monster of evil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greedy and cruel tarried but little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell and frantic, and forced from their slumbers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thirty of thanemen; thence he departed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaping and laughing, his lair to return to,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was Grendel’s prowess revealed to the warriors:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, his meal-taking finished, a moan was uplifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Morning-cry mighty. The man-ruler famous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The long-worthy atheling, sat very woful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suffered great sorrow, sighed for his liegemen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spirit accursèd: too crushing that sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Too loathsome and lasting. Not longer he tarried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one night after continued his slaughter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shameless and shocking, shrinking but little</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From malice and murder; they mastered him fully.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pleasanter place of repose in the lodges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bed in the bowers. Then was brought to his notice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Told him truly by token apparent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hall-thane’s hatred: he held himself after</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Further and faster who the foeman did baffle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So ruled he and strongly strove against justice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lone against all men, till empty uptowered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The choicest of houses. Long was the season:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twelve-winters’ time torture suffered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The friend of the Scyldings, every affliction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Endless agony; hence it after became</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certainly known to the children of men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sadly in measures, that long against Hrothgar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grendel struggled:⁠—his grudges he cherished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murderous malice, many a winter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strife unremitting, and peacefully wished he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Life-woe to lift from no liegeman at all of</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The men of the Dane-folk, for money to settle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No counsellor needed count for a moment</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On handsome amends at the hands of the murderer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The monster of evil fiercely did harass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ill-planning death-shade, both elder and younger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trapping and tricking them. He trod every night then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mist-covered moor-fens; men do not know where</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Witches and wizards wander and ramble.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So the foe of mankind many of evils</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grievous injuries, often accomplished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Horrible hermit; Heort he frequented,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gem-bedecked palace, when night-shades had fallen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Since God did oppose him, not the throne could he touch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The light-flashing jewel, love of Him knew not).</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the Scyldings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soul-crushing sorrow. Not seldom in private</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat the king in his council; conference held they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What the braves should determine ’gainst terrors unlooked for.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the shrines of their idols often they promised</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gifts and offerings, earnestly prayed they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The devil from hell would help them to lighten</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their people’s oppression. Such practice they used then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hope of the heathen; hell they remembered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In innermost spirit, God they knew not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Judge of their actions, All-wielding Ruler,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No praise could they give the Guardian of Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Wielder of Glory. Woe will be his who</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through furious hatred his spirit shall drive to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clutch of the fire, no comfort shall look for,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wax no wiser; well for the man who,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Living his life-days, his Lord may face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And find defence in his Father’s embrace!</span>
