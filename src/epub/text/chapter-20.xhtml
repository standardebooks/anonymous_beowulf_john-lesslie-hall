					<span>They sank then to slumber. With sorrow one paid for</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His evening repose, as often betid them</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While Grendel was holding the gold-bedecked palace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ill-deeds performing, till his end overtook him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death for his sins. ’Twas seen very clearly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Known unto earth-folk, that still an avenger</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outlived the loathed one, long since the sorrow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caused by the struggle; the mother of Grendel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Devil-shaped woman, her woe ever minded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who was held to inhabit the horrible waters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cold-flowing currents, after Cain had become a</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slayer-with-edges to his one only brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The son of his sire; he set out then banished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marked as a murderer, man-joys avoiding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lived in the desert. Thence demons unnumbered</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fate-sent awoke; one of them Grendel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sword-cursèd, hateful, who at Heorot met with</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man that was watching, waiting the struggle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where a horrid one held him with hand-grapple sturdy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nathless he minded the might of his body,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glorious gift God had allowed him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And folk-ruling Father’s favor relied on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His help and His comfort: so he conquered the foeman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hell-spirit humbled: he unhappy departed then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reaved of his joyance, journeying to death-haunts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Foeman of man. His mother moreover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eager and gloomy was anxious to go on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her mournful mission, mindful of vengeance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the death of her son. She came then to Heorot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the Armor-Dane earlmen all through the building</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were lying in slumber. Soon there became then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Return to the nobles, when the mother of Grendel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Entered the folk-hall; the fear was less grievous</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By even so much as the vigor of maidens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>War-strength of women, by warrior is reckoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When well-carved weapon, worked with the hammer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blade very bloody, brave with its edges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strikes down the boar-sign that stands on the helmet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the hard-edgèd weapon was heaved in the building,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a> o’er the benches, broad-lindens many</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hand-fast were lifted; for helmet he recked not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For armor-net broad, whom terror laid hold of.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She went then hastily, outward would get her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her life for to save, when some one did spy her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon she had grappled one of the athelings</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fast and firmly, when fenward she hied her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one to Hrothgar was liefest of heroes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In rank of retainer where waters encircle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mighty shield-warrior, whom she murdered at slumber,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A broadly-famed battle-knight. Beowulf was absent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But another apartment was erstwhile devoted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the glory-decked Geatman when gold was distributed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There was hubbub in Heorot. The hand that was famous</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She grasped in its gore; grief was renewed then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In homes and houses: ’twas no happy arrangement</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In both of the quarters to barter and purchase</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lives of their friends. Then the well-agèd ruler,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gray-headed war-thane, was woful in spirit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When his long-trusted liegeman lifeless he knew of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His dearest one gone. Quick from a room was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beowulf brought, brave and triumphant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As day was dawning in the dusk of the morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went then that earlman, champion noble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came with comrades, where the clever one bided</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether God all gracious would grant him a respite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the woe he had suffered. The war-worthy hero</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a troop of retainers trod then the pavement</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The hall-building groaned), till he greeted the wise one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The earl of the Ingwins; asked if the night had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fully refreshed him, as fain he would have it.</span>
