				<span>“Then bruised in his bosom he with bitter-toothed missile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is hurt ’neath his helmet: from harmful pollution</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is powerless to shield him by the wonderful mandates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the loath-cursèd spirit; what too long he hath holden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him seemeth too small, savage he hoardeth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor boastfully giveth gold-plated rings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fate of the future flouts and forgetteth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since God had erst given him greatness no little,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wielder of Glory. His end-day anear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It afterward happens that the bodily-dwelling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fleetingly fadeth, falls into ruins;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another lays hold who doleth the ornaments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nobleman’s jewels, nothing lamenting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heedeth no terror. Oh, Beowulf dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Best of the heroes, from bale-strife defend thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And choose thee the better, counsels eternal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beware of arrogance, world-famous champion!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But a little-while lasts thy life-vigor’s fulness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twill after hap early, that illness or sword-edge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall part thee from strength, or the grasp of the fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the wave of the current, or clutch of the edges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or flight of the war-spear, or age with its horrors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or thine eyes’ bright flashing shall fade into darkness:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twill happen full early, excellent hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That death shall subdue thee. So the Danes a half-century</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I held under heaven, helped them in struggles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst many a race in middle-earth’s regions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ash-wood and edges, that enemies none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On earth molested me. Lo! offsetting change, now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to my manor, grief after joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Grendel became my constant visitor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inveterate hater: I from that malice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Continually travailed with trouble no little.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thanks be to God that I gained in my lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Lord everlasting, to look on the gory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head with mine eyes, after long-lasting sorrow!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go to the bench now, battle-adornèd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joy in the feasting: of jewels in common</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We’ll meet with many when morning appeareth.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Geatman was gladsome, ganged he immediately</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To go to the bench, as the clever one bade him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then again as before were the famous-for-prowess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hall-inhabiters, handsomely banqueted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feasted anew. The night-veil fell then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dark o’er the warriors. The courtiers rose then;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gray-haired was anxious to go to his slumbers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hoary old Scylding. Hankered the Geatman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The champion doughty, greatly, to rest him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An earlman early outward did lead him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fagged from his faring, from far-country springing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who for etiquette’s sake all of a liegeman’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needs regarded, such as seamen at that time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were bounden to feel. The big-hearted rested;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The building uptowered, spacious and gilded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The guest within slumbered, till the sable-clad raven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blithely foreboded the beacon of heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the bright-shining sun o’er the bottoms came going;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warriors hastened, the heads of the peoples</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were ready to go again to their peoples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The high-mooded farer would faraway thenceward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look for his vessel. The valiant one bade then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Offspring of Ecglaf, off to bear Hrunting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take his weapon, his well-beloved iron;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He him thanked for the gift, saying good he accounted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The war-friend and mighty, nor chid he with words then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blade of the brand: ’twas a brave-mooded hero.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the warriors were ready, arrayed in their trappings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The atheling dear to the Danemen advanced then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On to the dais, where the other was sitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grim-mooded hero, greeted King Hrothgar.</span>
