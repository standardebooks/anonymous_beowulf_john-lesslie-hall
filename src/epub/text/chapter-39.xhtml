			<p>
				<span>It had woefully chanced then the youthful retainer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To behold on earth the most ardent-belovèd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At his life-days’ limit, lying there helpless.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slayer too lay there, of life all bereavèd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Horrible earth-drake, harassed with sorrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The round-twisted monster was permitted no longer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To govern the ring-hoards, but edges of war-swords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mightily seized him, battle-sharp, sturdy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leavings of hammers, that still from his wounds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flier-from-farland fell to the earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard by his hoard-house, hopped he at midnight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not e’er through the air, nor exulting in jewels</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffered them to see him: but he sank then to earthward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the hero-chief’s handwork. I heard sure it throve then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But few in the land of liegemen of valor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though of every achievement bold he had proved him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To run ’gainst the breath of the venomous scather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the hall of the treasure to trouble with hand-blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If he watching had found the ward of the hoard-hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the barrow abiding. Beowulf’s part of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The treasure of jewels was paid for with death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each of the twain had attained to the end of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Life so unlasting. Not long was the time till</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tardy-at-battle returned from the thicket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The timid truce-breakers ten all together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who durst not before play with the lances</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the prince of the people’s pressing emergency;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But blushing with shame, with shields they betook them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With arms and armor where the old one was lying:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They gazed upon Wiglaf. He was sitting exhausted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foot-going fighter, not far from the shoulders</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the lord of the people, would rouse him with water;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No whit did it help him; though he hoped for it keenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was able on earth not at all in the leader</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Life to retain, and nowise to alter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The will of the Wielder; the World-Ruler’s power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would govern the actions of each one of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As yet He is doing. From the young one forthwith then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could grim-worded greeting be got for him quickly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose courage had failed him. Wiglaf discoursed then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weohstan his son, sad-mooded hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked on the hated: “He who soothness will utter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can say that the liegelord who gave you the jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ornament-armor wherein ye are standing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When on ale-bench often he offered to hall-men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Helmet and burnie, the prince to his liegemen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As best upon earth he was able to find him⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he wildly wasted his war-gear undoubtedly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When battle o’ertook him. The troop-king no need had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To glory in comrades; yet God permitted him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Victory-Wielder, with weapon unaided</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself to avenge, when vigor was needed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I life-protection but little was able</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To give him in battle, and I ’gan, notwithstanding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Helping my kinsman (my strength overtaxing):</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He waxed the weaker when with weapon I smote on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mortal opponent, the fire less strongly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flamed from his bosom. Too few of protectors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came round the king at the critical moment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now must ornament-taking and weapon-bestowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home-joyance all, cease for your kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Food for the people; each of your warriors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must needs be bereavèd of rights that he holdeth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In landed possessions, when faraway nobles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall learn of your leaving your lord so basely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dastardly deed. Death is more pleasant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To every earlman than infamous life is!”</span>
