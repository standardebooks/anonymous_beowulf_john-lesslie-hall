					<span>Beowulf answered, Ecgtheow’s son:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Grieve not, O wise one! for each it is better,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His friend to avenge than with vehemence wail him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each of us must the end-day abide of</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His earthly existence; who is able accomplish</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glory ere death! To battle-thane noble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lifeless lying, ’tis at last most fitting.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arise, O king, quick let us hasten</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To look at the footprint of the kinsman of Grendel!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I promise thee this now: to his place he’ll escape not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To embrace of the earth, nor to mountainous forest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor to depths of the ocean, wherever he wanders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Practice thou now patient endurance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of each of thy sorrows, as I hope for thee soothly!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then up sprang the old one, the All-Wielder thanked he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ruler Almighty, that the man had outspoken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then for Hrothgar a war-horse was decked with a bridle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Curly-maned courser. The clever folk-leader</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stately proceeded: stepped then an earl-troop</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of linden-wood bearers. Her footprints were seen then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Widely in wood-paths, her way o’er the bottoms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where she faraway fared o’er fen-country murky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bore away breathless the best of retainers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who pondered with Hrothgar the welfare of country.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The son of the athelings then went o’er the stony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Declivitous cliffs, the close-covered passes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Narrow passages, paths unfrequented,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nesses abrupt, nicker-haunts many;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of a few of wise-mooded heroes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He onward advanced to view the surroundings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he found unawares woods of the mountain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er hoar-stones hanging, holt-wood unjoyful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water stood under, welling and gory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas irksome in spirit to all of the Danemen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Friends of the Scyldings, to many a liegeman</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sad to be suffered, a sorrow unlittle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To each of the earlmen, when to Aeschere’s head they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came on the cliff. The current was seething</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With blood and with gore (the troopers gazed on it).</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The horn anon sang the battle-song ready.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The troop were all seated; they saw ’long the water then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many a serpent, mere-dragons wondrous</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trying the waters, nickers a-lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the cliffs of the nesses, which at noonday full often</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go on the sea-deeps their sorrowful journey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wild-beasts and wormkind; away then they hastened</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hot-mooded, hateful, they heard the great clamor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The war-trumpet winding. One did the Geat-prince</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sunder from earth-joys, with arrow from bowstring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From his sea-struggle tore him, that the trusty war-missile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pierced to his vitals; he proved in the currents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less doughty at swimming whom death had offcarried.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon in the waters the wonderful swimmer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was straitened most sorely with sword-pointed boar-spears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pressed in the battle and pulled to the cliff-edge;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The liegemen then looked on the loath-fashioned stranger.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beowulf donned then his battle-equipments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cared little for life; inlaid and most ample,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hand-woven corslet which could cover his body,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must the wave-deeps explore, that war might be powerless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To harm the great hero, and the hating one’s grasp might</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not peril his safety; his head was protected</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the light-flashing helmet that should mix with the bottoms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trying the eddies, treasure-emblazoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Encircled with jewels, as in seasons long past</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The weapon-smith worked it, wondrously made it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With swine-bodies fashioned it, that thenceforward no longer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brand might bite it, and battle-sword hurt it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that was not least of helpers in prowess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Hrothgar’s spokesman had lent him when straitened;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the hilted hand-sword was Hrunting entitled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old and most excellent ’mong all of the treasures;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its blade was of iron, blotted with poison,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hardened with gore; it failed not in battle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Any hero under heaven in hand who it brandished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who ventured to take the terrible journeys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The battle-field sought; not the earliest occasion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That deeds of daring ’twas destined to ’complish.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ecglaf’s kinsman minded not soothly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exulting in strength, what erst he had spoken</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drunken with wine, when the weapon he lent to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sword-hero bolder; himself did not venture</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Neath the strife of the currents his life to endanger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fame-deeds perform; there he forfeited glory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Repute for his strength. Not so with the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he clad in his corslet had equipped him for battle.</span>
