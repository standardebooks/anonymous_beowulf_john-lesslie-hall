					<span>“It well may discomfit the prince of the Heathobards</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each of the thanemen of earls that attend him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he goes to the building escorting the woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a noble-born Daneman the knights should be feasting:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There gleam on his person the leavings of elders</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hard and ring-bright, Heathobards’ treasure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While they wielded their arms, till they misled to the battle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their own dear lives and belovèd companions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saith at the banquet who the collar beholdeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An ancient ash-warrior who earlmen’s destruction</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly recalleth (cruel his spirit),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sadly beginneth sounding the youthful</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thane-champion’s spirit through the thoughts of his bosom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>War-grief to waken, and this word-answer speaketh:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Art thou able, my friend, to know when thou seest it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brand which thy father bare to the conflict</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his latest adventure, ’neath visor of helmet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dearly-loved iron, where Danemen did slay him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brave-mooded Scyldings, on the fall of the heroes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(When vengeance was sleeping) the slaughter-place wielded?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en now some man of the murderer’s progeny</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exulting in ornaments enters the building,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Boasts of his blood-shedding, offbeareth the jewel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which thou shouldst wholly hold in possession!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he urgeth and mindeth on every occasion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With woe-bringing words, till waxeth the season</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the woman’s thane for the works of his father,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bill having bitten, blood-gory sleepeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fated to perish; the other one thenceward</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Scapeth alive, the land knoweth thoroughly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the oaths of the earlmen on each side are broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When rancors unresting are raging in Ingeld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his wife-love waxeth less warm after sorrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So the Heathobards’ favor not faithful I reckon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their part in the treaty not true to the Danemen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their friendship not fast. I further shall tell thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More about Grendel, that thou fully mayst hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ornament-giver, what afterward came from</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hand-rush of heroes. When heaven’s bright jewel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er earthfields had glided, the stranger came raging,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The horrible night-fiend, us for to visit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where wholly unharmed the hall we were guarding.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Hondscio happened a hopeless contention,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death to the doomed one, dead he fell foremost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Girded war-champion; to him Grendel became then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the vassal distinguished, a tooth-weaponed murderer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The well-beloved henchman’s body all swallowed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not the earlier off empty of hand did</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of evils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wish to escape from the gold-giver’s palace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sturdy of strength he strove to outdo me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hand-ready grappled. A glove was suspended</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spacious and wondrous, in art-fetters fastened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which was fashioned entirely by touch of the craftman</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the dragon’s skin by the devil’s devices:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He down in its depths would do me unsadly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One among many, deed-doer raging,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though sinless he saw me; not so could it happen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I in my anger upright did stand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis too long to recount how requital I furnished</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every evil to the earlmen’s destroyer;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas there, my prince, that I proudly distinguished</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy land with my labors. He left and retreated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lived his life a little while longer:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet his right-hand guarded his footstep in Heorot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sad-mooded thence to the sea-bottom fell he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mournful in mind. For the might-rush of battle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The friend of the Scyldings, with gold that was plated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With ornaments many, much requited me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When daylight had dawned, and down to the banquet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We had sat us together. There was chanting and joyance:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The age-stricken Scylding asked many questions</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of old-times related; oft light-ringing harp-strings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joy-telling wood, were touched by the brave one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now he uttered measures, mourning and truthful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the large-hearted land-king a legend of wonder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truthfully told us. Now troubled with years</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The age-hoary warrior afterward began to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mourn for the might that marked him in youth-days;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His breast within boiled, when burdened with winters</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much he remembered. From morning till night then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We joyed us therein as etiquette suffered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till the second night season came unto earth-folk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then early thereafter, the mother of Grendel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was ready for vengeance, wretched she journeyed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her son had death ravished, the wrath of the Geatmen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The horrible woman avengèd her offspring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with mighty mainstrength murdered a hero.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the spirit of Æschere, agèd adviser,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was ready to vanish; nor when morn had lightened</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were they anywise suffered to consume him with fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Folk of the Danemen, the death-weakened hero,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor the belovèd liegeman to lay on the pyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She the corpse had offcarried in the clutch of the foeman</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Neath mountain-brook’s flood. To Hrothgar ’twas saddest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of pains that ever had preyed on the chieftain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the life of thee the land-prince then me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Besought very sadly, in sea-currents’ eddies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To display my prowess, to peril my safety,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might-deeds accomplish; much did he promise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I found then the famous flood-current’s cruel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Horrible depth-warder. A while unto us two</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hand was in common; the currents were seething</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With gore that was clotted, and Grendel’s fierce mother’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Head I offhacked in the hall at the bottom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With huge-reaching sword-edge, hardly I wrested</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My life from her clutches; not doomed was I then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the warden of earlmen afterward gave me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jewels in quantity, kinsman of Healfdene.</span>
