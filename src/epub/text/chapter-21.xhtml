					<span>Hrothgar rejoined, helm of the Scyldings:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ask not of joyance! Grief is renewed to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk of the Danemen. Dead is Aeschere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yrmenlaf’s brother, older than he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My true-hearted counsellor, trusty adviser,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shoulder-companion, when fighting in battle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our heads we protected, when troopers were clashing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heroes were dashing; such an earl should be ever,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An erst-worthy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a> atheling, as Aeschere proved him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flickering death-spirit became in Heorot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His hand-to-hand murderer; I can not tell whither</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cruel one turned in the carcass exulting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By cramming discovered. The quarrel she wreaked then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That last night igone Grendel thou killedst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In grewsomest manner, with grim-holding clutches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since too long he had lessened my liege-troop and wasted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My folk-men so foully. He fell in the battle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With forfeit of life, and another has followed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mighty crime-worker, her kinsman avenging,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And henceforth hath ‘stablished her hatred unyielding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As it well may appear to many a liegeman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who mourneth in spirit the treasure-bestower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her heavy heart-sorrow; the hand is now lifeless</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which availed you in every wish that you cherished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Land-people heard I, liegemen, this saying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dwellers in halls, they had seen very often</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pair of such mighty march-striding creatures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far-dwelling spirits, holding the moorlands:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One of them wore, as well they might notice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The image of woman, the other one wretched</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In guise of a man wandered in exile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Except he was huger than any of earthmen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earth-dwelling people entitled him Grendel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In days of yore: they know not their father,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whe’r ill-going spirits any were borne him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ever before. They guard the wolf-coverts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lands inaccessible, wind-beaten nesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fearfullest fen-deeps, where a flood from the mountains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Neath mists of the nesses netherward rattles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stream under earth: not far is it henceward</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Measured by mile-lengths that the mere-water standeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which forests hang over, with frost-whiting covered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A firm-rooted forest, the floods overshadow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There ever at night one an ill-meaning portent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fire-flood may see; ’mong children of men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None liveth so wise that wot of the bottom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though harassed by hounds the heath-stepper seek for,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fly to the forest, firm-antlered he-deer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spurred from afar, his spirit he yieldeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His life on the shore, ere in he will venture</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To cover his head. Uncanny the place is:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence upward ascendeth the surging of waters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wan to the welkin, when the wind is stirring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The weathers unpleasing, till the air groweth gloomy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the heavens lower. Now is help to be gotten</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thee and thee only! The abode thou know’st not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dangerous place where thou’rt able to meet with</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sin-laden hero: seek if thou darest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the feud I will fully fee thee with money,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With old-time treasure, as erstwhile I did thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With well-twisted jewels, if away thou shalt get thee.”</span>
