				<span>For no cause whatever would the earlmen’s defender</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave in life-joys the loathsome newcomer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He deemed his existence utterly useless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To men under heaven. Many a noble</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Beowulf brandished his battle-sword old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would guard the life of his lord and protector,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The far-famous chieftain, if able to do so;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While waging the warfare, this wist they but little,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave battle-thanes, while his body intending</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To slit into slivers, and seeking his spirit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all on the earth, nor any of war-bills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was willing to injure; but weapons of victory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His death at that time must prove to be wretched,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the far-away spirit widely should journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into enemies’ power. This plainly he saw then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who with mirth of mood malice no little</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(To God he was hostile), that his body would fail him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Higelac’s hardy henchman and kinsman</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held him by the hand; hateful to other</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was each one if living. A body-wound suffered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The direful demon, damage incurable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was seen on his shoulder, his sinews were shivered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His body did burst. To Beowulf was given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glory in battle; Grendel from thenceward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must flee and hide him in the fen-cliffs and marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sick unto death, his dwelling must look for</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwinsome and woful; he wist the more fully</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The end of his earthly existence was nearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His life-days’ limits. At last for the Danemen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the slaughter was over, their wish was accomplished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The comer-from-far-land had cleansed then of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wise and valiant, the war-hall of Hrothgar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saved it from violence. He joyed in the night-work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In repute for prowess; the prince of the Geatmen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the East-Danish people his boast had accomplished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bettered their burdensome bale-sorrows fully,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The craft-begot evil they erstwhile had suffered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And were forced to endure from crushing oppression,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their manifold misery. ’Twas a manifest token,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the hero-in-battle the hand suspended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The arm and the shoulder (there was all of the claw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Grendel together) ’neath great-stretching hall-roof.</span>
