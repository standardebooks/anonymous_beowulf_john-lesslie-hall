				<span>“The blood-stainèd trace of Swedes and Geatmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The death-rush of warmen, widely was noticed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the folks with each other feud did awaken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The worthy one went then with well-beloved comrades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old and dejected to go to the fastness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ongentheo earl upward then turned him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Higelac’s battle he’d heard on inquiry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The exultant one’s prowess, despaired of resistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With earls of the ocean to be able to struggle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst sea-going sailors to save the hoard-treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wife and his children; he fled after thenceward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old ’neath the earth-wall. Then was offered pursuance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the braves of the Swedemen, the banner to Higelac.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fared then forth o’er the field-of-protection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the Hrethling heroes hedgeward had thronged them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then with edges of irons was Ongentheow driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gray-haired to tarry, that the troop-ruler had to</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffer the power solely of Eofor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wonred his son, that for swinge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> of the edges</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blood from his body burst out in currents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forth ’neath his hair. He feared not however,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gray-headed Scylfing, but speedily quited</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wasting wound-stroke with worse exchange,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the king of the thane-troop thither did turn him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wise-mooded son of Wonred was powerless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To give a return-blow to the age-hoary man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But his head-shielding helmet first hewed he to pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That flecked with gore perforce he did totter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell to the earth; not fey was he yet then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But up did he spring though an edge-wound had reached him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Higelac’s vassal, valiant and dauntless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his brother lay dead, made his broad-bladed weapon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giant-sword ancient, defence of the giants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound o’er the shield-wall; the folk-prince succumbed then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shepherd of people, was pierced to the vitals.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There were many attendants who bound up his kinsman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carried him quickly when occasion was granted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the place of the slain they were suffered to manage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This pending, one hero plundered the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His armor of iron from Ongentheow ravished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hard-sword hilted and helmet together;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old one’s equipments he carried to Higelac.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He the jewels received, and rewards ’mid the troopers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Graciously promised, and so did accomplish:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The king of the Weders requited the war-rush,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hrethel’s descendant, when home he repaired him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Eofor and Wulf with wide-lavished treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To each of them granted a hundred of thousands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In land and rings wrought out of wire:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None upon mid-earth needed to twit him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the gifts he gave them, when glory they conquered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to Eofor then gave he his one only daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The honor of home, as an earnest of favor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That’s the feud and hatred⁠—as ween I ’twill happen⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The anger of earthmen, that earls of the Swedemen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will visit on us, when they hear that our leader</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifeless is lying, he who longtime protected</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hoard and kingdom ’gainst hating assailers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who on the fall of the heroes defended of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deed-mighty Scyldings, did for the troopers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What best did avail them, and further moreover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hero-deeds ’complished. Now is haste most fitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the lord of liegemen we look upon yonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And <em>that</em> one carry on journey to death-pyre</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who ring-presents gave us. Not aught of it all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall melt with the brave one⁠—there’s a mass of bright jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold beyond measure, grewsomely purchased</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ending it all ornament-rings too</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bought with his life; these fire shall devour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flame shall cover, no earlman shall wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A jewel-memento, nor beautiful virgin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have on her neck rings to adorn her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wretched in spirit bereavèd of gold-gems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shall oft with others be exiled and banished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mirth and merriment. Hence many a war-spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaved in the hand, no harp-music’s sound shall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waken the warriors, but the wan-coated raven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fain over fey ones freely shall gabble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, the wolf his companion, he plundered the slain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the high-minded hero was rehearsing these stories</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loathsome to hear; he lied as to few of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weirds and of words. All the war-troop arose then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Neath the Eagle’s Cape sadly betook them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping and woful, the wonder to look at.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They saw on the sand then soulless a-lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His slaughter-bed holding, him who rings had given them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In days that were done; then the death-bringing moment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was come to the good one, that the king very warlike,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wielder of Weders, with wonder-death perished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First they beheld there a creature more wondrous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The worm on the field, in front of them lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foeman before them: the fire-spewing dragon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was scorched in the fire; as he lay there he measured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fifty of feet; came forth in the night-time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rejoice in the air, thereafter departing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To visit his den; he in death was then fastened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There stood round about him beakers and vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With iron-rust eaten, as in earth’s mighty bosom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand of winters there they had rested:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That mighty bequest then with magic was guarded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold of the ancients, that earlman not any</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ring-hall could touch, save Ruling-God only,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sooth-king of Vict’ries gave whom He wished to</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(He is earth-folk’s protector) to open the treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>E’en to such among mortals as seemed to Him proper.</span>
